# phaser

have you ever been working and thought, I need to know the moon phase immediately? Well I have the thing for you!
I made a very small python script that will display the moon in ascii art glory right in your terminal

This app reaches out to an API to get the current moon phase and displays an ascii art image of it, a discription of the phase (ie. Waxing Crescent) and the name of the current cycle (ie. Moon before Yule).

exit the app by pressing any key

To do:
Make better looking moon ascii art :P
